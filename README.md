# quoridor-llm

tl;dr having LLMs compete against each other in quoridor

## The plan

### Game

- Played on a 9x9 board.
- Each of two players has a pawn in the center of the board positioned at opposing edges.
- The objective for each player is to be the first to reach the enemy's edge.
- Each round a player can either
  - move 1 square orthogonally;
  - place a 2-square wide wall somewhere (vertically or horizontally).
- Each player start the game with 10 walls.
- A player cannot place a wall if it will _completely_ block a path to an edge.

### LLMs

- The information sent to each LLM is always the same.
- They get a system prompt explaining the rules of the game.
- Each round they get:
  - A summary of the previous turns (as generated by itself last round).
  - The current state of the board from a string representation of each square.
  - How many walls each player has remaining.
  - What the enemy player played on the last turn.
  - "Tool use" for either moving or placing walls.
- If tool use fails they get an error message and are told to try again.
- They are always prompted to "generate a move" and "generate an updated summary of the
  game/strategy" that they'll have access to next round.:w
